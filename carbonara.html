    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed</li>
        <li>8 slices bacon, diced</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>&frac14; cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>&frac12; cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. 
            Drain, toss spaghetti with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place diced bacon in a large skillet over medium heat; 
            cook and stir until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. 
            Drain bacon on paper towels, reserving 2 tablespoons bacon fat in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to bacon fat in the skillet. 
            Add chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onion is translucent. 
            Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. 
            Add wine and cook 1 minute more.</li>
        <li>Return cooked bacon to the skillet; add cooked spaghetti. 
            Toss to coat and heat through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry or sticks together. 
            Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or a large fork, until eggs are barely set. 
            Quickly add &frac12; cup Parmesan cheese and toss again. 
            Season with salt and pepper (remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty).</li>
        <li>Serve warm wih chopped parsley sprinkled on top and extra Parmesan chees at the table.</li>
    </ol>
